# Dice game

Code developed in Java using the javax.swing.JOptionPane package to create a dice mine game, where it simulates the throw of a dice twice consecutively using random numbers from 1 to 6. Depending on the value of the sum of the two dice you win, lose or tie and then the program asks you if you want to play again, if so it restarts, if not it finishes.

The code is located in the folder "palcoPrincipal", the file "Jogo_Dados.java" is where the game code is, while the "Estado.java" is an enum, with the statuses won, lost, continue.
